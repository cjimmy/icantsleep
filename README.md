#i can't sleep

A computationally generated font that only works given a certain background. This is an openFrameworks project, built with OF 0.7.1.

###installation
Put this entire directory into a folder "icantsleep" under apps > myApps > icantsleep in your openFrameworks directory.
Then open the xcode project and run it.

!["alphabet"](/imgs/alphabet.png)


###to do
M and W are wide letters that I have yet to implement. There are also some funny things I have to fix regarding the lines, but they are only noticeable upon closer inspection.
